# 3-heuristic-algorithms-in-Python-for-Travelling-Salesman-Problem
As alternative heuristic techniques; genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm and city swap algorithm are implemented in Python for Travelling Salesman Problem. Details on implementation and test results can be found in this repository. 

All 3 algorithms have been tested as a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem. In our problem, it is assumed that the 2-dimensional Euclidean space is valid. That is, distances will be calculated as 2-dimensional euclidean distances. In our problem, coordinates of 51 cities are used as dataset from a csv file. If you want, you can enter new city coordinates in the csv file or edit the already entered ones and run the algorithms again. The programs have been written to allow you to edit the dataset as you wish. 
And the best known solution's cost for this symmetric TSP is 426.
